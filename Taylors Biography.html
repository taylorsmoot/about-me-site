    <p class="intro">My name is Taylor Smoot. I’m 17 years old, a rising senior in high school, and a soccer player with a deep passion for the game<br> and for the mindset behind it. Soccer has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember, but I’ve learned that the mental part of the game is just as important as the physical.
<br><br>
Growing up Black in a sport that’s often dominated by white spaces hasn’t always been easy. I’ve faced pressure, unfair assumptions, and the feeling that I had to prove myself just to be taken seriously. But those challenges taught me something powerful: mental strength, self-awareness, and confidence aren’t optional they’re survival tools.
<br><br>Off the field, I’m into a lot more than just soccer. My favorite team is Angel City FC in the NWSL, and I look up to players like Crystal Dunn who represent strength, skill, and resilience. I also code, play guitar, and design graphics creativity is a huge part of who I am. This site is a space where all of that comes together: my story, my passions, and my voice.
